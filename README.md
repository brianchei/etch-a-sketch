# etch-a-sketch
Welcome to my online rendition of the popular etch-a-sketch toy! This project is a submission to the assignment from the Odin Project "Project: Etch-a-Sketch" from the Foundations pathway. For this project, I implemented a variety of features including the original etch-a-sketch functionalities: a pen that draws following the cursor, a button that erases and creates a new grid as well as some extra features: the pen colors random (RGB) colors instead of the traditional black, and squares are darkened each time they are hovered over by the cursor. Some of the primary tools/methods I utilized include DOM manipulation, javascript promises, object event listeners, and loops/arrays. I really enjoyed making this project and I hope you find interesting!
